               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               Although I have an intense fear of heights.. one day I would love to visit the Grand Canyon. Just don't look down! &#128549;

               <h2>New York City</h2>
               <p>
               You wouldn't expect an introvert like myself to be interested in visting such a densely populated city..
               However, I'm intrigued by all of the architecture and I've heard the food is amazing! You'd never catch me living there though. &#128517;

               <section class="Paris">
                  <h2>Paris, France</h2>
                  <p>
                  I have yet to travel outside the country, but I think this would be the first place I'd like to visit, if ever given the opportunity. 
                  From the unique culture, amazing landscapes, scenery, art, history, food and archtitecture.. It seems like there's endless things to do and enjoy there!
                  I believe that's why it remains one of the most visited cities in the entire world!
